### Key Components

#### 1. Imports and Dependencies
```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/structs/EnumerableSet.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Counters.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Address.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol";
import "./interfaces/IPushCore.sol";
import "./libraries/PushLibrary.sol";
```
**Review**:
- **OpenZeppelin Imports**: 
  - **EnumerableSet**: Provides functionality for managing sets of addresses or other types.
  - **Counters**: Handles counter values safely.
  - **Address**: Contains functions for address management.
  - **Ownable**: Implements ownership control.
  - **Initializable**: Allows the contract to be upgradeable.
- **Local Imports**: 
  - **IPushCore**: An interface that defines the contract's core functionality.
  - **PushLibrary**: A library that provides helper functions related to the push notification protocol.

| Import                  | Purpose                                       |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `EnumerableSet`         | Manage sets of addresses or types.            |
| `Counters`              | Safely manage counters.                        |
| `Address`               | Utility functions for address handling.       |
| `Ownable`               | Basic authorization control for ownership.    |
| `Initializable`         | Support for upgradeable contracts.            |
| `IPushCore`             | Interface defining core functionalities.      |
| `PushLibrary`           | Helper functions for the push notification protocol. |

#### 2. Contract Definition
```solidity
contract PushCoreV2 is Initializable, Ownable, IPushCore {
    using EnumerableSet for EnumerableSet.AddressSet;
    using Counters for Counters.Counter;

    // State variables
    Counters.Counter private _notificationCount;
    EnumerableSet.AddressSet private _subscribers;
    mapping(address => mapping(bytes32 => bool)) private _notificationStatus;
}
```
**Review**:
- **Contract Inheritance**: The contract inherits from `Initializable`, `Ownable`, and `IPushCore`, allowing it to manage ownership, initialization, and defining its interface.
- **State Variables**:
  - **`_notificationCount`**: Keeps track of the total number of notifications sent.
  - **`_subscribers`**: Manages a set of addresses that have subscribed to notifications.
  - **`_notificationStatus`**: A nested mapping that tracks whether a particular address has received a specific notification.

| Variable Name            | Type                             | Description                                   |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `_notificationCount`     | `Counters.Counter`               | Counts the total notifications sent.          |
| `_subscribers`           | `EnumerableSet.AddressSet`       | Stores addresses subscribed to notifications. |
| `_notificationStatus`     | `mapping(address => mapping(bytes32 => bool))` | Tracks if an address has received a notification. |

#### 3. Functions

**Example Function: Subscribe to Notifications**
```solidity
function subscribe() external {
    require(!_subscribers.contains(msg.sender), "Already subscribed");
    _subscribers.add(msg.sender);
}
```
**Review**:
- **Function Purpose**: Allows users to subscribe to notifications.
- **Require Statement**: Checks that the caller isn’t already subscribed to prevent duplicates.
- **Adding Subscriber**: If not already subscribed, adds the caller’s address to the `_subscribers` set.

| Function Name            | Visibility   | Description                               |
|--------------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `subscribe`              | `external`   | Subscribes the caller to notifications.   |

**Example Function: Send Notification**
```solidity
function sendNotification(address recipient, string memory message) external onlyOwner {
    // Implementation of sending notification
    emit NotificationSent(recipient, message, _notificationCount.current());
    _notificationCount.increment();
}
```
**Review**:
- **Function Purpose**: Sends a notification to a specified recipient.
- **Visibility**: This function can only be called by the owner of the contract.
- **Event Emission**: Emits a `NotificationSent` event after successfully sending the notification.
- **Notification Count**: Increments the notification count after sending.

| Function Name            | Visibility   | Modifier     | Description                              |
|--------------------------|--------------|--------------|------------------------------------------|
| `sendNotification`       | `external`   | `onlyOwner`  | Sends a notification to a recipient.    |

#### 4. Events
```solidity
event NotificationSent(address indexed recipient, string message, uint256 notificationId);
```
**Review**:
- **Purpose**: This event is emitted whenever a notification is sent.
- **Indexed Parameter**: The `recipient` is indexed, which allows easy filtering of events in logs based on the recipient’s address.

| Event Name               | Description                                    |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `NotificationSent`       | Logs details of the notification sent.        |

### Conclusion
