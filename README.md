## Basic Contract Information

### Introduction
The EPNS Push Notification Protocol is a decentralized protocol enabling push notifications in the Ethereum ecosystem. It serves as a core part of the EPNS protocol, which allows decentralized applications (dApps) to send notifications to users in a secure and efficient manner.

### Scope
This review covers:
- Code architecture and logic
- Core functionalities
- Security measures and potential vulnerabilities

---

## What Does This Contract Do?

### Contract Overview

The EPNS Push Notification Protocol contract encompasses the following primary functionalities:
1. **Subscription Management**: Allows users to subscribe and unsubscribe from notifications.
2. **Notification Sending**: Sends notifications to subscribed users.
3. **Administration**: Manages permissions for administrators.

Think of this contract as a YouTube-like platform where:

1. Users can create channels (like YouTube channels)
2. Users can stake tokens (like subscribing but with money)
3. Channel owners get rewards (like YouTube monetization)


### Main Components:

#### 1. Channels üì∫
```solidity
struct Channel {
    ChannelType channelType;
    uint8 channelState;      // 0: Inactive, 1: Active, 2: Deactivated, 3: Blocked
    address verifiedBy;      // Who verified this channel
    uint256 poolContribution;// How much they deposited
    // ... other details
}
```

#### 2. Staking System üí∞
```solidity
struct UserFessInfo {    // Note: There's a typo in 'Fees'
    uint256 stakedAmount;
    uint256 stakedWeight;
    uint256 lastStakedBlock;
    uint256 lastClaimedBlock;
    // ... other details
}
```

#### 3. Rewards Distribution üéÅ
- Users stake PUSH tokens
- Rewards are calculated based on epochs (time periods)
- Each epoch is about 20 days long

  

### Detailed Analysis

#### Architecture
The architecture demonstrates a modular approach, breaking down functions for easy readability and maintenance. Key components include:
- **Subscription logic**: Handling user subscriptions.
- **Notification logic**: Mechanisms for sending notifications.
- **Access control**: Authorization checks for specific actions.

#### Core Functionalities
1. **Subscription Management**:
   - Users can subscribe to and unsubscribe from notifications.
   - Checks to prevent duplicate subscriptions.

2. **Notification Sending**:
   - Allows sending of notifications to users based on their subscription status.
   - Implements checks to ensure notifications are only sent to valid subscribers.

3. **Access Control**:
   - Uses role-based access control for administrative actions.
   - Security functions ensure only designated addresses can manage key functions.

#### Security Considerations
This contract applies several security practices:
- **Access Control Checks**: Ensures only permitted addresses can execute administrative functions.
- **Reentrancy Guards**: Prevents potential reentrancy attacks in notification or subscription processes.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures user inputs are validated before state changes.

## Key Components

#### 1. Imports and Dependencies
```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/structs/EnumerableSet.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Counters.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Address.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol";
import "./interfaces/IPushCore.sol";
import "./libraries/PushLibrary.sol";
```
**Review**:
- **OpenZeppelin Imports**: 
  - **EnumerableSet**: Provides functionality for managing sets of addresses or other types.
  - **Counters**: Handles counter values safely.
  - **Address**: Contains functions for address management.
  - **Ownable**: Implements ownership control.
  - **Initializable**: Allows the contract to be upgradeable.
- **Local Imports**: 
  - **IPushCore**: An interface that defines the contract's core functionality.
  - **PushLibrary**: A library that provides helper functions related to the push notification protocol.

| Import                  | Purpose                                       |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `EnumerableSet`         | Manage sets of addresses or types.            |
| `Counters`              | Safely manage counters.                        |
| `Address`               | Utility functions for address handling.       |
| `Ownable`               | Basic authorization control for ownership.    |
| `Initializable`         | Support for upgradeable contracts.            |
| `IPushCore`             | Interface defining core functionalities.      |
| `PushLibrary`           | Helper functions for the push notification protocol. |

#### 2. Contract Definition
```solidity
contract PushCoreV2 is Initializable, Ownable, IPushCore {
    using EnumerableSet for EnumerableSet.AddressSet;
    using Counters for Counters.Counter;

    // State variables
    Counters.Counter private _notificationCount;
    EnumerableSet.AddressSet private _subscribers;
    mapping(address => mapping(bytes32 => bool)) private _notificationStatus;
}
```
**Review**:
- **Contract Inheritance**: The contract inherits from `Initializable`, `Ownable`, and `IPushCore`, allowing it to manage ownership, initialization, and defining its interface.
- **State Variables**:
  - **`_notificationCount`**: Keeps track of the total number of notifications sent.
  - **`_subscribers`**: Manages a set of addresses that have subscribed to notifications.
  - **`_notificationStatus`**: A nested mapping that tracks whether a particular address has received a specific notification.
  - The use of a nested mapping to track notification statuses is efficient. However, it could potentially lead to high gas costs if there are numerous notifications per subscriber.


| Component                | Description & Risks                                           |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Initialization           | Ensure initialization function is called to avoid issues.   |
| Access Control           | `Ownable` provides basic control; consider more roles.      |
| Notification Tracking     | Efficient but could incur high gas costs with many notifications. |

## üîç Important Functions


### 1. Channel Creation
```solidity
function createChannelWithPUSH(
    ChannelType _channelType,
    bytes calldata _identity,
    uint256 _amount,
    uint256 _channelExpiryTime
) external whenNotPaused
```

**What it does:**

- Creates a new channel
- Takes PUSH tokens from user
- Sets up channel settings

**Security Checks:**
  
- ‚úÖ Checks if enough tokens deposited
- ‚úÖ Verifies channel doesn't already exist
- ‚ùå Missing zero-address check
- ‚ùå No validation for _identity parameter

  
### 2. Staking Function
```solidity
function stake(uint256 _amount) external {
    _stake(msg.sender, _amount);
    emit Staked(msg.sender, _amount);
}
```


**Example Function: Subscribe to Notifications**
```solidity
function subscribe() external {
    require(!_subscribers.contains(msg.sender), "Already subscribed");
    _subscribers.add(msg.sender);
}
```

**What it does:**

- Lets users deposit PUSH tokens
- Calculates their staking weight
- Updates reward tracking

**Common Issues:**
  
- No maximum stake limit
- No cooldown period
- Rewards can be manipulated with large stakes



### 3. Reward Claims
```solidity
function harvestAll() public {
    uint256 currentEpoch = lastEpochRelative(genesisEpoch, block.number);
    uint256 rewards = harvest(msg.sender, currentEpoch - 1);
    IERC20(PUSH_TOKEN_ADDRESS).safeTransfer(msg.sender, rewards);
}
```

**What it does:**

- Calculates user's rewards
- Sends rewards to user
- Updates claim history

### 4. Subscribe to Notifications
```solidity
function subscribe() external {
    require(!_subscribers.contains(msg.sender), "Already subscribed");
    _subscribers.add(msg.sender);
}

```
**What it does:**

- Allows users to subscribe to notifications.
- Checks that the caller isn‚Äôt already subscribed to prevent duplicates.
- If not already subscribed, adds the caller‚Äôs address to the `_subscribers` set.

**Common Issues:**
- This function does not involve any external calls or state changes that could trigger reentrancy, which is positive.
- The error message could be more informative. Using `require` is good for checking conditions, but a message indicating how to unsubscribe could enhance user experience.

  
### 5. Send Notification
```solidity
function sendNotification(address recipient, string memory message) external onlyOwner {
    // Implementation of sending notification
    emit NotificationSent(recipient, message, _notificationCount.current());
    _notificationCount.increment();
}
```
**What it does:**
- Sends a notification to a specified recipient.
- This function can only be called by the owner of the contract.
- Emits a `NotificationSent` event after successfully sending the notification.
- Increments the notification count after sending.

| Function Name            | Visibility   | Modifier     | Description                              |
|--------------------------|--------------|--------------|------------------------------------------|
| `sendNotification`       | `external`   | `onlyOwner`  | Sends a notification to a recipient.    |


**Common Issues:**
- This function is restricted to the owner. If the owner‚Äôs private key is compromised, an attacker could send false notifications. Implementing a multi-signature approach for sensitive actions like sending notifications could be considered.
- Each notification increments the notification count, which is efficient, but we can ensure that this doesn‚Äôt lead to excessive gas costs if the function is called frequently.
- There should be validation for the `recipient` address to ensure it is not the zero address. This could prevent sending notifications to invalid recipients.

| Function | Who Can Call | Risk Level |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| createChannelWithPUSH | Anyone | Low |
| stake | Anyone | Low |
| blockChannel | Only Admin | High |
| pauseContract | Only Admin | High |

### 2. Money Flow Checks

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User] -->|Stake| B[Contract]
    B -->|Rewards| A
    C[Channel Creator] -->|Deposit| B
```


**Key Questions to Ask:**

- Where does money come in?
- 
- Where does money go out?
- 
- Who controls the money flow?
  




#### 4. Events
```solidity
event NotificationSent(address indexed recipient, string message, uint256 notificationId);
```
**Review**:
- **Purpose**: This event is emitted whenever a notification is sent.
- **Indexed Parameter**: The `recipient` is indexed, which allows easy filtering of events in logs based on the recipient‚Äôs address.

| Event Name               | Description                                    |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `NotificationSent`       | Logs details of the notification sent.        |

### Conclusion
